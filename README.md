# ToDoList using React!

### Tech Stack: React.js

This project was developed using React.js, which I learned through the GDSC KU study group and Coding Apple’s lectures.

### Challenges

- Due to my limited understanding of React, the code became messy and visually unappealing.
- The application lacks a save feature for persistent data storage.

### Solutions & Limitations

- utilized GPT to help improve the readability and structure of my code.
- However, I wasn’t able to implement a saving mechanism for the service.

### Reflections & Future Goals

To be honest, this project doesn’t quite reflect my style, and I didn’t feel a strong connection to it.
I’m not sure if it’s because I’m not particularly interested in front-end development, or if it’s just that the ToDo list project itself didn’t excite me. Moving forward, I want to explore a wider range of projects to discover what truly interests me and helps me grow as a developer.
